        <div id="nacho-text">Nacho Libre is a 2006 sports comedy-drama film directed by Jared Hess and written by Jared and Jerusha Hess and Mike White. It stars Jack Black as Ignacio, a Catholic monk and lucha libre fan who secretly moonlights as a luchador to earn money for the orphanage where he works by day as a cook, knowing his fellow monks would look down upon his career and expel him if they discover it. He finds his ascetic, celibate lifestyle challenged even further when he falls in love with a nun who has just arrived to live in the monastery. The film is loosely based on the story of Fray Tormenta ("Friar Storm", a.k.a. Rev. Sergio Gutiérrez Benítez), a real-life Mexican Catholic priest who had a 23-year career as a masked luchador and competed in order to support the orphanage he directed. The film was produced by Black, White, David Klawans and Julia Pistor.

It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $99.3 million at the worldwide box office against its $35 million production budget. Despite the initial mixed reaction from critics, it has since earned a cult following. </div>
